<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of `spatInfer` is to run spatial regressions that are robust to trends and autocorrelation in the data, and to provide diagnostics to test the accuracy of the inference method. At the same it aims to be extremely simple to use, requiring only a sequence of four commands.

## Installation

You can install the development version of spatInfer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("morganwkelly/spatInfer")
```

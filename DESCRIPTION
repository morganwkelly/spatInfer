Description: Strong trends and autocorrelation can lead to seriously inflated t-statistics in regressions
    with spatial observations regardless of the validity of their identification strategy. An 
    estimation procedure is implemented where a low dimensional spatial basis is added to the regression and large cluster
    inference is applied. Two diagnostic tests are provided (a) a placebo test where the treatment
    is replaced with spatial noise and (b) a synthetic outcomes test of the hypothesis that the outcome
    is generated by a spatial noise process independent of the treatment.

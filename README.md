<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of `spatInfer` is to run spatial regressions that are robust
to trends and autocorrelation in the data, and to provide diagnostics to
test the accuracy of the inference method. At the same it aims to be
extremely simple to use, requiring only a sequence of four commands.

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
